Hi I'm Surmud Jamil and I'm a senior year computer science major at the University of Maryland, College Park. Some things I'm interested in are software engineering, data science, and machine learning. Since you're already stalking my github profile, you may as well take a look at some of my projects and give me some feedback. If you'd like to reach out to me, you can connect with me on Linkedin at www.linkedin.com/in/surmud
